# Philip Burns North Plains Interview Tech Task

notes:

- definitely got lazy on the tests towards the end, as it's a Sunday evening
- parallelism isn't immediately obvious, but I used parallel streams, which noticably reduced the execution time by a few seconds
- used pythagoras to calculate rough distance between lat and long points
- although the assignment specifies production code - there are many things which I would change to productionise it but didnt due to time constraints. This includes more tests, not using any system printlns, and probably more comments
